# Project Shwaas

## Field Expedited Open Source Oxygen Concentrator

 This project has been inspired by the tragedy unfolding in India, with the desire to do something meaningful and practical. Currently, it appears that India has a massive supply chain problem which is preventing local authorities and the central government from transporting meaningful quantities of liquid 'medical' oxygen to cities and towns.
 
 The reality is that even today, the vast majority of Indians live in the rural parts of the country. Based on various news reports and having lived in India for a good part of my life, I am painfully aware that this may almost be an impossible task. Certain parts of the Indian news media are reaching a conclusion that absolutely nothing can be done to save lives at this point.
 
 While the world has generously donated O2 concentrators in large numbers, It is highly unlikley that they will reach the places where they are needed the most in time to make any difference during this devastating second wave (Covid-19)

Things are so bad, that everyday we see visuals of mass deaths occuring in Intensive Care Wards of hospitals in major metropolitan cities. Many people are dying at home, who could be saved with access to Oxygen.
 
 ## Project Goals
1. Easy to build
2. Least amount of specialty parts as possible
3. Safe
4. Consistent Output in therapeutic concentrations of Oxygen
